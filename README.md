# Sales Prediction - Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts a continuous output.

Types of Linear Regression : 
1. Simple Regression
We define the linear relationship for a given dependent variable `y` as ouput and the independent variable `x`as input. The model tries to fit a straight line by predicting the coefficients `m`(slope) and `b`(intercept) where variables `m` and `b` are optimized to produce accurate predictions.
