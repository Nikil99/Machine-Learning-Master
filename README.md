# Sales Prediction - Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts a continuous output.


***Simple Regression***
* We define the linear relationship for a given dependent variable `y` as ouput and the independent variable `x`as input. The model tries to fit a straight line by predicting the coefficients `m`(slope) and `b`(intercept) where variables `m` and `b` are optimized to produce accurate predictions.

***Cost Function***
* We define the cost funciton MSE (Mean Square Error) that measures the average squared differnce between actual and predicted values. Our goal is to minimize this cost function in order to improve the accuracy of the model.
